# AgriKart
AgriKart is a Django-based Farmer-to-Consumer Marketplace that eliminates middlemen and helps farmers sell their crops directly to consumers. It provides a transparent, fair, and efficient platform where farmers can upload, manage, and sell their produce, while consumers can browse and purchase fresh crops at affordable prices.
