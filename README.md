# AgriKart
AgriKart is a Django-based Farmer-to-Consumer Marketplace that eliminates middlemen and helps farmers sell their crops directly to consumers. It provides a transparent, fair, and efficient platform where farmers can upload, manage, and sell their produce, while consumers can browse and purchase fresh crops at affordable prices.
## ✨ Features  

- 👨‍🌾 **Farmer Dashboard** – Add, edit, and delete crops.
